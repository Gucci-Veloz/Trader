This document outlines Cursor's vulnerability disclosure policy. For more information about Cursor's approach to security, please visit [cursor.com/security](https://cursor.com/security).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We commit to acknowledging vulnerability reports immediately, and will work to fix active vulnerabilities as soon as we can. We will publish resolved vulnerabilities in the form of security advisories on our GitHub security page. Critical incidents will be communicated both on the GitHub security page and via email to all affected users.
